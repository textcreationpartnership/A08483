            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

what madneſſe is entred into their braines, that with ſuch Owles faces, they dare in the open lighte of the Goſpell, ſchritch forth their olde abſurdities, as though now after the great inſtruction of the truth, they were able to thruſt forth vnto vs (as in times paſt when they lead vs in the darke) their counterfaite ware, to deceaue vs, and ſo turne vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the glorious lighte of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. We had thought they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their aunſwere long agoe, &amp; would neuer haue durſte to looke the trueth in the face againe: but nowe as they are continually inſtructed from that ſame enemy of truth, ſo they bring forth their olde rotten ſtuffe, and their new Ieſuites haue furbuſhed ouer their olde argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their blinde predeceſſors, &amp; as if they were ſpicke &amp; ſpanne newe, they offer them vnto vs. But we finde them all of one metall. This onely is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that whereas they were wont to ſpeake in their owne language and like themſelues, nowe they ſpeake in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſembling voyce, and being in caſe to couch for feare of the whippe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13841:5"/>
they haue turned their ruſtie roughnes into ſome ſmoothnes, and like Angels of lighte, that they may haue ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment amongeſt vs: and to the end they may infect the lande againe with their idolatries, and turne vpſide downe the quiet peace the bleſſing of the Goſpell hath brought vs, and drinke vp our bloud, (as together with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt their head they haue done in times paſt, and in the countries, where they haue had entertainment rounde about vs;) with ſtrong flatterie, they prepare euen to creepe into our boſomes. And he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are thoſe ſpeaches vſed by Parſons Howlet, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fraudulent and doubling Epiſtle, that he of late hath preſumed to whoope in the eares of her Soueraigne Highnes, wherewith becauſe I haue dealt more fully in another place, now I do but touch it. But as there is greateſt daunger when foes beginne to faigne, ſo haue we greateſt cauſe to diſtruſt theſe enemies of God and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, when they haue made their tongues moſt glyb and ſmoothe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue withall,<note place="margin">August. in Pſal. <hi>9.</hi>

For a ſinner delighteth to doe thoſe things, wherein not onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouer is feared, but alſo the praiſer is heard. There are therfore more dangers vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tongue of a flatterer, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of a perſecutor. For where as the hande reacheth but to the bodie, the falſe praiſe and faigned loue of a flat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terer, turneth mens hearts from the ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of the truth. And therefore we ought to take heede of theſe flattering Papiſts, as of the enemies,<note place="margin">August. ad Demetria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. Epiſt. <hi>142,</hi>
               </note> not of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but of our ſoules, whoſe ſofteſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches and glauering praiſes, which they pounce out to the vttermoſt, to ſteale in vpon vs, &amp; to gain againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, are ſo many ſwords &amp; darts to our ſoules. Thei corrupt light mindes with their faigned praiſes, &amp; in the mindes of thoſe that are light of credite, they giue gentle wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. Thei couer their poiſon with hony. And this vice hath ſo encreaſed in this our age, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſtands at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt ſtint &amp; cannot be encreaſed: euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> applieth this ſtudy, &amp; giueth himſelfe wholy to follow this ſchole, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may deceiue &amp; be deceiued.

we receaue that willingly of others, which we offer as a gift to others, &amp; the hope of receauing praiſe maketh vs to praiſe thoſe to their faces of whom we would be praiſed. We oftentimes refuſe the praiſe of flatterers, when they ſpeake to our faces, and yet we nouriſh their flatteries in our mindes, and thinke we haue gained much with men, when God knoweth &amp; our conſciences tell vs that they are forged and faigned. We do not thinke what we are our ſelues in deede, but what we ſeeme to be to others. And hence it is, that the moſt men puſh at the opinion of the worlde: they labour to be well thought of, fetching the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their credite, rather from a lying fame, than a ſounde conſcience. But happie are they that perfectly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this vice, that neither flatter, nor beleue thoſe that flatter, that depend not vpon the blaſts of mens mouthes, but ſtudie to approue themſelues to God, whoſe iudgement is according to truth. And I beſeech the Lord, that her Highnes with all her Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel &amp; Nobles, may be indued with this wiſdome from

But I ſee Sathan is like himſelfe, and his children beare his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance: that which they can not compaſſe one way, they wil attempt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

Her perſon crowne and dignity, her right ouer all perſons in gouerning them according to Gods word, and keeping her ſubiects in order, are matters of ſtate. And therfore the matter is not miſtaken, concerning the Bull of Pius Quintus, that hath, if it be of force, taken the crowne which God hath ſet vpon her highnes head, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, and diſcharged all her ſubiects from her obedience.

For verily, they chiefly ſerue the Church of Chriſt, who allured by the ſweetnes of the heauenly doctrine (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue taſted how good the Lorde is) and being ſtirred vp with a care of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting his glory, offer vp to the faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yea rather to Chriſt himſelfe, their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13841:16"/>
yea and in a ſorte themſelues alſo. And truely it is a great matter, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tender yeres to haue deeply taſted Christ in his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly doctrine: for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily flow (as Peter calleth it) that ſame deſire of the ſyncere milke of his worde,<note place="margin">1.

Many good and learned men here, know that this was the beſt and principal cauſe of the publiſhing hereof, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated (ſome yeares paſt) thoſe things which now I ſet forth, and alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the purpoſe of the publiſhing therof: But hitherto, I haue deferred the ſame, becauſe I feared leaſt this ſimplicitie of teaching, and writing not ſo filed and laboured, ſhould not ſatisfie many, wherwith I endeuoured not ſo much to feede their eares as their mindes. An other cauſe was, that it might be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of doctrine, againſt that ſame tempeſt which in many places is ſtirred vp againſt this Church. Againſt this, I would ſet this bulwarke of ſande, if peraduenture God who is mightie in the weake, would vouchſafe to appeaſe the ſame in the mindes of certaine more moderate than the reſt, &amp; alſo aſſwage it a litle in others. For I haue thought of

that ſame greate power of God, whereby he hath ſet vnto the ſea her bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it woulde ſeeme with his hugenes, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme the whole earth, by the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, all his force is broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſofte ſand: I haue truſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that through this ſimple and plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, of the groundes of our religion, which hitherto we haue vſed, that the Lord would bring ſome good thinge to paſſe, for the appeaſing of certaine mens mindes, vnto whom peraduenture our innocencie, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto hath beene leſſe knowne. Many keepe a great ſtirre, as though horrible doctrine ſounded in the congregation of this Church, and ſuch rumors are ſcattered abrode farre and wide. Some may ſay that euen a ſea of ſclaunderous reproches, is vomited out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, wherewith we might be drowned. But whie rage you, ô good ſirs? (for let it be free for me, by your highnes leaue, euen to compell them) conſider all the articles of our Christian faith, will you finde in any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch matter of raging? Be not all thinges exacted to the rule of God his word, and are they not directed to edification in true and ſound godlines? If you your ſelues doe not

feele that ſame conſolation in your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this doctrine, I will freely graunt, that iustlie you riſe vp againſt vs: But take heed I beſeech you, that you riſe not vp againſt your owne conſcience, againſt God himſelfe, who in the conſcience hath erected his high ſeate. For certeinly nothing hath bin done of vs in corners. We haue manie, yea innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable witneſſes of the expoſition of this chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan doctrine, yea your highnes it ſelfe, who ſhal reade the ſelfeſame thinges here, which publiquely you heaue now hard theſe fiften yeres paſt, in which it hath pleaſed the Lord that I ſhould deliuer here vnto his Church theſe principall grounds of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith.

Sure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly I my ſelfe being but yet a boye, was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully kindled with a deſire both of learning &amp; teaching others concerning God; in outward ſhew vpon very ſmall occaſion, but indeede vpon very great: for I fell vpon the writing of a certaine excellent learned man, where almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this purpoſe he exhorteth youth: there is nothing more excellent (ſaith

Theſe ſeemed to me altogether religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy ſayings, and it pleaſed the Lord by theſe wordes to kindle in me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſparkes of a feruent deſire both of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and in time to come, of inſtructing others, either in the ſchoole, or in the Church. For I ſet before mine eies the company of young men in the ſchoole, alſo the flocke of learners in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: What can be more notable (thought I) then to haue there before me, not onely young men, but alſo hoare headed huſbandmen, who together with thy ſelfe are baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paradiſe, for ſinne, &amp; like Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, who for their old age are reuerend, and as fathers: many women alſo, who are as mothers: if the Lord will haue thee to ſpeake his word vnto theſe, and to inſtruct them of God, of the creation and preſeruation of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13841:20"/>
worlde, of the ſubtiltie of the ſerpent deceauing man, of the promiſed ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſeede of the woman: what can be more comfortable, what can happen vnto thee, more to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for of God? ſeeing without the knowledge of theſe thinges men liue more miſerably than brute beaſts. The Lord continually after that time nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed theſe ſparks in me, by his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by the reading of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I was then a boye of fifteene yeres olde, and a little before, for ſtudies ſake, ſent to Paris by my parents. But to what ende ſpeake I theſe thinges ſo familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? I ſpeake as a young man, to young men: hoping, that it will come to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things which were not of ſmall moment in my minde, will likewiſe in your mindes kindle the ſparkes, which may engender that earneſt deſire aſwell of learning, as of teaching. And ſo much the more, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhall perceaue your ſelues, not only prouoked by my exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but alſo (God giuing you grace,) holpen by this my little labour. For although before I was ſixteene yeres

old, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was ſent to Paris, I had ſome direction by my ſchoolemaiſters, who yearely before Eaſter did expounde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the ſchoole called <hi>Treuiror,</hi> the paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and were wont according to the meaſure God had giuen them, to conferre the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the olde Teſtament, with the accompliſhing thereof by the paſſion of Chriſt (a thing very comfortable, &amp; which afterwards, by the grace of God, opened vnto me the whole ſcope of the ſcriptures:) yet notwithſtanding that handleading was more dark &amp; obſcure, by reaſon of the multitude of mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in which, Chriſt dead &amp; raiſed vp againe was wrapped &amp; darkened, in the popedome, ſo, that I coulde not well vſe that light, which by the conference &amp; comparing of thoſe figures, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the thinges themſelues I did ſee to ſhine in the paſſion of Chriſt: But yet for all that, that ſame weake fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in his time, God bleſſing it, wanted not his excellent fruite. But here dearely beloued youth, you ſhall ſee Chriſt, dead, and raiſed vp againe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13841:21"/>
without any mazes of mens traditions, ſo liuely ſet before your eies, that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſure and vndoubted propheticall and apoſtolicall worde, as it were by the hand, yea as by a light ſhining in a dark place being brought vnto him, you may knowe him truely to be the ſame, who was made vnto vs of God, to be our wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and redemption, as it is written. All that glory, let them glory in the Lorde. 1. Cor. 1. and that we are compleate in him: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coloſſ. 2. Laſt of al for aſmuch as the vnthankefulneſſe of the world, doth driue away and feare many both from learning and teaching, goe to, ſhall not Chriſt puniſh the worlde for this vnthankefulneſſe? If he remaine faithfull, ought not this to ſatiſfie vs? Chriſt the Lord of heauen and earth will not ſuffer you ſeruing him, to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtitute of neceſſary things: but he that prouideth ſeede to the ſower, he alſo will prouide bread for foode. I haue oftentimes thought of that ſame ſaying of Chriſt, Luk. 22. When I ſent you without bagge and ſcrippe and ſhoes,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13841:21"/>
wanted ye any thing? his diſciples aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Nothing: yea, they did not once remember, whether they ſhould neede any helpe, for their iourny, &amp; executing of their office. The ſame Chriſt yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp; raigneth God for euer, who hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearts of all in his hands, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may do good to all faithfull paſtors: euen as he had commanded (be it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpake neuer a word) to the widowe of Sarepta, that ſhee ſhould giue foode to her ſeruant Elias. I haue alſo oftentimes thought of that ſame ſaying of Daniel: that the reward of Chriſt his ſeruantes are laide vp for them, in the heauens. The tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (ſaith he) ſhall ſhine, as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the firmament, and they that haue brought others vnto righteouſnes, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres in euerlaſting times. Let vs therefore content our ſelues in our calling, with meane things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne ouer our ſelues to our heauenly father to be fed through Chriſt at his hands, we, our wiues and our children: for he is the true father, and will neuer be vnmindefull of compaſſion, &amp; a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care ouer vs, and ſo much the leſſe he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13841:22"/>
will be vnmindefull, by how much we ſhall be more mindefull of our calling. We may therefore ſafely committe our ſelues and ours to his prouidence, which ought to ſuffice for the ouercomming of all hinderaunces &amp; letts, ſpecially to them to whom God is all in all.</p>

The vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall adminiſtration of this kingdome of Chriſt, is that ſame newe couenant, that God hath promiſed in the laſt times to make with vs by Ieremy the Prophet, not according to that ſame couenant he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the lande of Aegypt, becauſe they had made that couenant voide: but that this ſhould be the couenaunt, that he would giue his lawe in the middeſt of vs; and that he would write it in our hearts, and that he would be our God, and we ſhould be his people, and that we ſhould knowe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would be mercifull vnto our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would not remember our ſinnes any more.

Now afterwards, things thus ſet in order, he offreth the worde of reconciliation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth faith in them, through which he communicateth himſelfe (after whom they thirſt,) vnto them; to this ende, that hauing obtained through his merite, iuſtification, they may vſe it to the euerlaſting peace of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and may dayly alſo through his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be reſtored and builded vp. Laſtly he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth thoſe that are reconciled, and thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with his ſpirit, to bring forth workes, worthy thoſe that repent, to the ende, that the glory of their king may ſhine in them. Rom. 8. ver. 29 30. Theſe degrees, in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdome of Chriſt, and of his new couenaunt, the Lord comprehendeth in that ſame ſpeach to Paule, when he ſaith, <hi>that thou mayſt open their eyes:</hi> that is done, when through the working of that king Chriſt, their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is illuminated through the holy Ghoſt. (For it is he that maketh his miniſterie effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13841:25"/>
ſo as they knowe both themſelues and their ſinnes, and againe God, his holyneſſe and righteouſneſſe, to which they muſt be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, that through faith turning vnto him, they may receaue in Chriſt a double benefite, forgiuenes of their ſinnes, &amp; a lot amongeſt the ſanctified, who daily ſtudie (Chriſt exhorting them) to bring forth the worthy fruites of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

                  <p>CHriſt the King doth engender in his elect the ſtudie of reconciling them ſelues to God: firſt of all by ſhewinge that all men are vnder ſinne, and in the kingdome of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13841:25"/>
eſpecially becauſe that when all men haue the knowledge of God, naturally engraffed in them, and the worke of the lawe by nature written in their heartes, and by the thinges cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated are conſtreined to knowe God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doe not glorifie him, but doe ſinne contrarie to the lawe of nature. Rom. 1. The which thing they witnes in their deedes, and their owne conſcience doth conuince their thoughtes, either accuſing or excuſing them. Againe by vncouering all and euerie of their wickedneſſes, and in accuſing them by the lawe written, and by the threatninges which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt euerie where throughout the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, many wickedneſſes alſo being heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as plainely may be ſeene in the Epiſtle to the Romaines, Chap 3. verſ. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And alſo by ſhewing that this is the vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able will of God, whereby he will not onely that all men be conformed to the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo to the lawe written, otherwiſe that he will ſo long accounte them for ſinners and enemies til they be conuerted, and through faith be reconciled vnto God. Iohn. 3 verſ 36. Rom. 5. verſ. 10, 11. Secondly by ſhewing what a great euil ſin is. Such and ſo great an euil ſin is, that it deſerueth the euerlaſting deſtruction of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea verily ſo great an euil, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it cannot by the euerlaſting deſtruction of man be cleanſed. Wherevppon it foloweth that ſinne is a greater euill, then mans euerlaſting damnation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that the damned cannot by euerlaſting paines cleanſe or ouercome ſo greate an euill.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13841:26"/>
To conclude, it is ſo greate an euill, to haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the maieſtie of God but with one ſinne, that the deſtruction of all creatures were a leſſe euill. For certainly neither the deſtruction of all creatures, yea if they ſhoulde be brought to nothing, were a ſufficient price for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of one onely ſinne: which could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be cleanſed, but by the death of the ſonne of God. Thirdly by ſhewing that the nature of God is righteous, and therefore that it doth accurſe all ſinners, to wit as well theire bodies as ſoules, as well in this worlde as in the world to come, Deut. 28. vnleſſe reconciliation be made. For ſo immutable is this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, and will to iudge ſinnes, that not ſo much as one ſinne amongſt ſo many thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes, which dayly are committed, ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vnpuniſhed. For either it is puniſhed in vs or els in Chriſt: in Chriſt it is once perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed, ſo that we repent and amende and beleeue in him: in our ſelues it ſhalbe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we haue an vnbeleeuing hearte and ſuch a a one as cannot repent, as Chriſt ſaith: verily I ſay vnto you, that men ſhall make accounte for euerie idle word in the day of iudgement. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if this be done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> green wood, what ſhal be done in the dry? 1. Peter, 4. verſe 17, 18. To be ſhort, god is ſo righteous; and ſo great an euil is ſin, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen when he doth forgiue ſinnes, he doth not yet alowe them: and that he may ſhew this thing he doth chaſtiſe them, in thoſe that are conuerted, yea, after the forgiuenes thereof with moſt ſharpe ſcourges, as in Dauid, yea,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13841:26"/>
after God had ſpoken vnto him by Nathan the Prophet: <hi>The lord hath taken from thee thy ſins:</hi> We ſee by how ſharpe whips he declared that he did not allow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſin of Dauid, 2. Sam. 12. ver. 11.12.13. alſo 2. Sam. cap. 24 verſ. 10.12. Fourthly by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the execution of the righteouſnes &amp; iudgment of God, againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impenitent &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing.

For euen like as men after great enimities are then at length paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their mindes, when they haue bounde themſelues by promiſes and by an oath each one to other, to imbrace peace; ſo alſo God, that our conſciences might be quiet, hath not ſpared of his meere goodnes euen by an oath and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt to binde himſelfe vnto vs that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant

Moreouer euen like as there are wonte to be propounded, in mens couenaunts certaine heades, which they call articles, by which peace is begunne and put in practiſe, both ſides being ſworne: ſo alſo that ſame diuine couenaunt, wherein God doth reconcile vs vnto himſelfe for euer, is conteined in certaine heades or articles, which are the foundations of this holy recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and where in God will haue eternall peace betweene him ſelfe and all beleeuers to be ratified. Now God had promiſed by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie the Prophet that he woulde ſtrike a newe couenaunt with vs, not according to that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he had made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had made that couenant voyde: but that this ſhould be the couenant; that he would giue the lawe in the middeſt of vs, and write the ſame in our heartes, and that he would be our God, and we ſhould be his pepple, and that we ſhould knowe him, becauſe he is mercifull vnto our ſinnes and will remember our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities no more. Ieremy, 31, Eſai. 53.54. Ozee. 2.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13841:28"/>
This couenant the Lord hath made with vs through faith in Chriſt: and therfore we muſt knowe that the articles of our faith, containe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſumme &amp; as it were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heads of that couenant which ſtandeth in faith between God and vs.</p>

This deſcription of faith, firſt comprehendeth the whole life of man: whoſe ſingular actions and moments, muſt needes leane and reſt vpon faith. For ſurely, that which is ſaid to the Hebrues, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> is moſt true, in all and ſingular matters that are to be taken in hand. Rom. 14. ver 23. Then after that it ſetteth forth that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar grace of iuſtification offred in Chriſt, and that reſtoring to euerlaſting life, as the foundation of all beleeuers. Now this ſame deſcription of faith is ſpecially taken out of the fourth Chap. to the Romanes, from the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth verſe, and out of the firſt Chapiter of the Epheſians, from the 17. verſe, to the ende of both the Chapiters. That which is put in the deſcription, of the will of God knowen, is therefore done, becauſe Sathan is oftentimes

                  <head>The profite of this deſcription of God.</head>
                  <p>THe vſe of this deſcription is, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God being knowne, we ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace by true faith, as our onely and moſt ſoueraigne God, and ſhould feare to offende him: to the end that through true faith and feare, or amendment of life, he might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of vs. For firſt when we heare that God, who hath promiſed by an euerlaſting coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that he wilbe a God vnto vs, is an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wiſe, euerlaſting, good, righteous and mercifull God  we conclude verie rightly vppon it, of the verie forme of that free couenant: that he is not onely ſuch a one by nature, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will ſhew himſelfe to be ſuch a one to vs beleeuers; and that by an euerlaſting couenant, though all creatures ſhould ſeeme to perſuade vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie. He that knoweth this nature of God, of whom he is receiued into couenant: he hath large matter of truſting in him, and of framing his life by faith, according to the will of God. Both of theſe, to wit howe the knowledge of God maketh to faith and repentance, and ſo to the eſtabliſhing of the kingdome of God in vs, we will make plaine out of ſome of his attributes. So great and ſo conſtant is the truth of God, that one word of the diuine truth, paſſeth the truth of all Angels and men: becauſe the truth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13841:33"/>
of all creatures, dependeth vpon the truth of God, and hath the originall from that, and conſiſteth in that alone: ſo that the truth of god, is the cauſe and foundation of all truth both in Angels and men. When therefore we wauer or doubt of any matter, why do we not conſult, whether there be not ſome word of the Lorde concerning that matter, whereof we doubt? which being found, we may giue our mindes to reſt, knowing aſſuredly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the leaſt title of the truth is more firme, then the whole frame of heauen and earth. Ieremi 31. Matt. 5. verſ. 18. therefore it is ſaide in the ſecond booke of the Kinges, Cap. 10. verſ. 10. Knowe you nowe, that there ſhall not fall anie thing of the word of the Lord to the ground. Alſo his infinite power ought to incourage vs, to truſt in him: in him I ſay, that mightie God, who calleth thoſe thinges which are not as if they were. Ro. 4. Like as alſo, that ſame Apoſtle further ſpeaketh of the faith of Abraham: <hi>He doubted not of the promiſe of God through vnbeleife, but was made strong in faith, giuing glorie to God: Being fully aſsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he which had promiſed, he alſo was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</hi> And ſurely how greatly diſtruſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth God, as which defraudeth him of his glory and how greatly the holieſt men that are ought to beware of it, the Lord teacheth Num. 20. And the Lord of Hoaſtes ſaid vnto Moyſes and Aaron, <hi>Foraſmuch as ye haue not beleeued me, that you might ſanctifie me before the ſonnes of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, therefore you ſhall not lead this congregation into the lande which I haue giuen them.</hi> And in the 32.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13841:33"/>
of Deut. 50.51.52. Now he is not onely able to do that, which he wil, (as in verie deede he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that thing which he hath promiſed in his word:) but alſo in that which he willeth not, he abideth no reſiſtance, which is as it were the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the omnipotencie of God. Iſai. 43. <hi>There is none that can take out of my hand: And if I do any thing, who ſhall let it?</hi> The firſt is therfore, that in euerie thing we haue the wil of God knowne out of his word, which being once knowne, let vs not doubt, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gods truth is moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, &amp; altogether vnchangable. Moreouer let our mindes mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> almightie nature of God, who mightily performeth in deede whatſoeuer he wil, neither abideth any reſiſtance Ioh. 10. <hi>I giue euerlaſtnig life to my ſheepe, neither ſhall they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for euer: neither ſhal any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take them out of my hand. My father who hath giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all, neither can any man ſnatch them out of the hand of my father. I and the father are one.</hi> Here thou haſt both the moſt conſtant truth of the word of Chriſt, and alſo his omnipotencie. And ſo thou muſt truſt: that God offereth himſelfe vnto vs in Chriſt, a true and almightie God, in an euerlaſting couenant. And further, ſhould not this ſelfeſame nature of God, wherein he is true and almightie, pricke vs forward to amendement, and to lead a life through faith according to his will? For whileſt we heare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his truth is one and vnchangeable, let vs know for a ſuertie, that he will not for euer approue ſinnes, which he hath witneſſed to detect by his word. Pſal. 5. Moreouer, that it is more poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13841:34"/>
that heauen &amp; earth ſhould be ouerthrown, then that thoſe puniſhmentes ſhould not fall out, which he hath threatened in his word, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we turne from our ſinnes. Mat. 5. verſ. 18. For the nature of God muſt be changed, if his truth were ſubiect to change. And the ſame reaſon is of his omnipotencie. For who would not wholy addict himſelfe vnto him, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether depend vpon his becke, and frame all thinges to his will, in whoſe hand is life and death, who hath power to caſt both body and ſoule into euerlaſting fire? As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Feare not thoſe which kill the body, but can do nothing againſt the ſoule: I ſay vnto you, whom you muſt feare, euen him that hath power to caſt both body and ſoule into hell fire.</hi> The infinite wiſdome of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth much for the eſtabliſhing of our truſt in him, as for example thus: that faith may ouercome whatſoeuer is obiected of the fleſh and of ſinne againſt the word and workes of God, and that it may at once breake all the broyles &amp; aſſaultes of diſtruſtes, &amp; giue it ſelfe to reſt: it muſt needes be that the minde aſcend vp to that infinitenes of the wiſdome &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of God, &amp; that it ſafely reſt in that, as doing all thinges wiſely and well, and be fully perſuaded that God is the gouernor of the world, and not men: and that he doth ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne all thinges, that we neither can nor ought to wiſh them wiſelier or better done, then they are or may be done of God. Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to reſt in that ſame infinite wiſdome of God, in the 11. to the Romanes, <hi>O the depth, ſayth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13841:34"/>
he, of the riches, aſwell of the wiſdome, as of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, how vnſearchable are his iudgementes, and his waies paſt finding out! Who hath knowne the minde of the Lord? or who hath beene of counſel with him? or who hath giuen vnto him firſt, and he ſhalbe recompenſed againe? for of him, by him, and in him are all thinges, to him be glorie worldes without end Amen.</hi> And Iſai in the 40. chapter, verſ. 13.14. and in the 104. Pſal. verſ. 24. <hi>O Lord of hoaſtes how are thy workes multiplied? Thou haſt done all thinges in wiſdome.</hi> And Pſalm. 147. verſ. 5. <hi>Our Lord is great and mightie in ſtrength, there is no number of his vnderſtanding.</hi> When therefore we heare our moſt wiſe, yea, our onely wiſe God, who hath promiſed that he will ſhew himſelfe ſuch a wiſe God towardes vs; who ſhould not receiue his wordes with high reuerence, and haue a contented minde in all, and thoſe moſt dayly workes of his prouidence as done moſt wiſely, an ſo reſt in his wiſdome? The which diuine wiſdome the Apoſtle wondring at, doth therewithall praiſe it. <hi>To the only wiſe God, be glorie,</hi> Romanes cap. 16. verſ. 37. Therfore alſo the wiſdome of God doth incourage vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: ſeeing he hath promiſed to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſuch a one towardes vs. Alſo who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wiſdome doth not according to his word, as the briefe rule of wiſdom, frame his his life? Pſal. 119. Now after that we haue by faith layd holde vpon the omnipotencie and wiſdome of God in all his workes, hauing vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denied our owne wiſdome of the fleſhe, Rom. 8. it followeth that he be acknowledged
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13841:35"/>
alſo to be good. Now his goodnes is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, aſwell in all effectes, as in forgiuing of ſinnes. Concerning the firſt, whatſoeuer is done of God, it is good, and thou muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it as verie good. For how can any other thing but good proceede from him in whom there is nothing but good? Therefore Dauid grauely and ſhortly ſaith, <hi>Iehoua is good to all, and his mercie is ouer all his workes.</hi> Pſal. 145. Thou haſt a ſingular vſe and practiſe of this doctrine in the 107. Pſalme. Furthermore his goodnes &amp; mercy, whereby amongeſt the reſt of his workes he taketh away iniquitie &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, ought ſo to reare vp our faith, that if the fleſh feare, leſt he ſhould caſt vs off, for our iniquitie and wickednes, faith ought fully to be reſolued, that this is the nature of God, as Moſes ſaith, to take iniquitie and ſinnes, to witte from the beleeuers. Now the nature of God is vnchangeable, wherefore vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would take them from vs, ſo that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. This nature of God ſhineth in the face of Chriſt, when he ſaith, <hi>Be of good cheere my ſonne: Thy ſinnes be forgiuen thee.</hi> Who therefore would not truſt in him? who alſo hauing heard of this ſo great goodnes, would go on wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and wittingly to offend him? As the Apoſtle ſaith in the 2. to the Rom. verſ. 4.5. <hi>Doeſt thou deſpiſe the riches of his goodnes, long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and gentlenes, not knowing that his goodnes doth prouoke thee to repentance? But thou after thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and harte that cannot repent, heapeſt vnto thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath, and of the iuſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13841:35"/>
of the righteous iudgement of God?</hi> Who alſo hauing heard of his mercie, doth not feare to doe any man wrong, or vniuſtly to oppreſſe his neighbour? like as in verie deede by this his nature, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is merciful, he turneth vs away from all hardnes of hearte, and inhumanitie. Exo. 22.26.27. <hi>If thou take the garment of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a pledge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before the ſun go downe, thou ſhalt reſtore it againe vnto him, becauſe it is his onely couering, it is his garment to couer his ſkinne, in which he ſhould ſleepe. And when he ſhall crie vnto me to heare him, I will heare him: becauſe I am mercifull.</hi> Yea alſo the righteouſnes of God, doth ſo ſhine in the face of his Chriſt, that alſo the moſt iuſt nature of God expreſſed in the lawe, may comfort vs in Chriſt, and confirme our hope, which otherwiſe in our ſelues may worthily terrifie vs. For ſeing that God is moſt righteous, and hath once called into iudgement the ſinnes of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and hath puniſhed them in his ſonne, in the full rigour of his iuſtice; the moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature of God will not beare, that the ſame debte once perfectly paide and clenſed, ſhould be twiſe or againe repaide vnto him. Againe, foraſmuch as God is ſo righteous, that an innocent before him is not innocent, that is, he is ſuch an exact examiner of ſinnes, that euen the moſt righteous in mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch as are not guiltie of any thing in them ſelues, 1. Cor. 4. verſ. 3. before him are not innocent: but doth viſite the ſinnes of the fathers vpon the childrens children to the

Cor. 6.7.8.9.11. and the firſt Theſ. 4.6.7.8. The euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting nature of God alſo doth confirme our faith. For ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch a one hath promiſed in couenant to be our God, who is euerlaſting, we rightly gather thereof, that not onely our ſoules ſhall liue in God, but alſo that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhalbe raiſed vp to life: that the euerlaſting God, may be indeede their God. And ſurely vpon this foundation leaneth that reaſon of Chriſt, whereby he prooueth againſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces out of the workes of the couenaunt, the reſurrection of the dead.

                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, Cap. 10. verſ. 15. affirmeth that theſe ſame wordes of the lord proceeded from the holy ghoſt. The holy ghoſt alſo himſelfe witneſſeth vnto vs. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had foreſhewed, This is my couenant that I will make with them, &amp;c. The which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Ioel affirmeth, Cap. 2. whom Peter alſo ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and expoundeth, that he may ſhewe them as plaine effectes of the holy Ghoſt which are altogether belonging to the power of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: <hi>I wil, ſaith Iehouah powre out of my ſpirit vpon all fleſh, and your ſonnes and daughters ſhall prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe thinges which are alledged now, to ſhew that the holy Ghoſt is God the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: by them alſo is ſhewed that he is an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding eſſence, euerlaſting, good, righteous, mercifull, moſt free, of an infinite power and moſt conſtant truth: neuertheleſſe let vs yet ſee alſo certaine teſtimonies ſeuerally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13841:44"/>
thoſe thinges that are attributed vnto him: which as they onely agree vnto God, ſo they plainly proue the holy Ghoſt to be very God.</p>
                  <p>That the holy Ghoſt is an vnderſtanding eſſence, euerlaſting, and which giueth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it plainly appeareth out of the 61. of Eſai: <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord Iehouah is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, for that Iehouah hath anointed me: to preach vnto the milde he hath ſent me.</hi> Luk. 4. Chriſt teacheth that he is he, <hi>vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the ſpirit of Iehouah, for that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him.</hi> But to anoint inwardly, as Chriſt properly is anointed, and by his owne power to ſend to preach glad tidinges, and to giue power to preach glad tidinges aright, is a work of a perſon truely ſubſiſting, vnderſtanding, and of the euerlaſting God. Alſo it appeareth by his effectes which are rekoned vp in the 5. to the Galathians, that he is alſo good, iuſt, pure, mercifull, moſt free, and in deede as God communicating his giftes vnto other. The fruites of the ſpirit is loue, ioy, peace, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, benignitie, goodneſſe, faith, ſoftneſſe of ſpirit, and temperance. And ſurely the ſame Apoſtle teacheth that the holy Ghoſt is the worker of theſe, and therefore God. 1. Cor. 12. <hi>There are diuerſitie of giftes, but the ſame ſpirite. And there are diuerſitie of adminiſtrations, but God is the ſame that worketh all in all. But the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit is giuen to euery man to profitte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For to one is giuen by the ſpirite, the worde of wiſedome: and to another the worde of knowledge by the ſame ſpirite.</hi> And a little after, <hi>But all theſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13841:44"/>
thinges worketh one and the ſame ſpirite, diſtributing to euery man ſeuerally as he will.</hi> Loe he had ſaide before: There are diuerſitie of adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but God is the ſame that worketh all in all: afterwards ſhewing that the ſame holy ſpirit is God himſelfe, he ſaith: All theſe things worketh one and the ſame ſpirit, diſtributing to euery man ſeuerally as he will. That he is true, and that as God looking into the heartes, and trying the thoughts, it is taught in the 5. of the Acts. <hi>Peter ſaid, Ananias, why hath Sathan filled thy heart, that thou ſhouldeſt lie vnto the holy Ghoſt?</hi> and by and by he addeth, <hi>Thou hast not lyed vnto men, but vnto God.</hi> And that he proceedeth from the father and the ſonne, not as a created mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or mouing, but as a perſon exiſting, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and of the ſame eſſence with the father &amp; the ſonne, Chriſt teacheth in Ioh. Cap. 14. verſ. 26. <hi>Now that ſame holy ſpirit the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom the father ſhall ſende in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and ſhall put all theſe things into your minde which I haue ſaid vnto you.</hi> But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to God 1. Cor. 2. verſ. 10.11.12. He iuſtifieth and ſanctifieth the Church aſwell as the ſonne: 1. Cor. 1.6. 1. Pet. 1. and renueth it to euerlaſting life. Ioh. 3. &amp; baptiſeth into the ſame body. 1. Cor. 12. He dwelleth in the beleeuers, and raiſeth them vp from the deade. Rom. 8. <hi>If his ſpirit who hath raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead dwell in you, he will alſo quicken your mortall bodies, by his ſpirit dwelling in you.</hi> And verily he dwelleth in vs, as in his owne temple. Therefore the holy Ghoſt muſt neceſſarily be the true God. 1.

Cor. 3. verſ. 16. <hi>Doe you not knowe that you are the temple of God, and that the ſptrite of God doth dwell in you? &amp;c.</hi> Now in the 2. Cor. cap. 6. he ſaith, <hi>Ye are the temple of the liuing God, as God hath ſaide, I will dwell in them, and walke there. &amp;c.</hi>

For God alwaies hath the end ioyned with his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the ſaluation of the faithfull.

For like as anointing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at Gods commandement Kinges, Prieſtes, and prophets were appointed amongſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with an outwarde and viſible oyle, was a publike teſtimonie, that God would gouerne &amp; efend his people by this perſon, &amp; alſo kepe &amp;

And in the firſt of Luke the Angel ſaith to Marie, <hi>This ſhall be great, and he ſhal he called the ſonne of the moſt high, and the Lorde God ſhall giue vnto him the ſeate of Dauid his father, and he ſhall raigne ouer the houſe of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob for euer, and there ſhall bee no end of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And a little after Zacharie the father of Iohn Baptiſte, being full of the holy Ghoſt, prophecied ſaying, <hi>Bleſsed be the Lorde God of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrael, becauſe he hath viſited and redeemed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hath lifted vp an horne of ſaluation vnto vs, in the houſe of Dauid his ſeruaunt, as he hath ſpoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which were ſince the world began, that it ſhould come to paſſe, that he would ſaue vs, from our enemies, and out of the hande of all that hate vs: that he ſhoulde ſhewe mercie towardes our fathers, and be mindfull of his holy couenaunt, of the oath which he ſware vnto Abraham our father, that he woulde giue vnto vs, &amp;c.</hi> to the end of the Chapter. Therefore I vnderſtand, that by the title of Chriſte or annointed the office of the

mediator of the couenaunt is expreſſed, to wit by what way and meanes the heauenly father leadeth vs, to ſaluation, promiſed and ſworne in the couenaunt by the hande of the mediator, that is to ſay, by his merite and vertue. Nowe the meane is, becauſe the father hath annointed this Ieſus to be the prophet or teacher, who can informe vs of this free couenaunt of God: to be the Prieſt, who confirmeth and ratifieth this couenaunt by his interceſſion and ſacrifice: and to be a king, who maintaineth his couenaunt made, and enricheth and defendeth his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; confederate ones: &amp; ſo, that in the whole buſineſſe of ſaluation, wee flie by faith vnto Chriſt, as to him whom the father hath ſigned, as Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh of him ſelfe. Ioh. 6. And firſt for that which concerneth the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall office of Chriſt, I thinke, that to pertaine to the couenaunt in ſuch ſort: to wit, that firſte of all, men bee inſtructed of the free coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of ſaluation, and therefore <hi>When in times past God ſpake after ſundrie ſortes and wayes by the Prophetes, nowe at length hee woulde ſpeake vnto vs by his ſonne.</hi> Heb. 1. to wit, clothed with mans nature: For otherwiſe the ſonne alſo ſpake by the Prophetes 1. Pet. 1. Wee muſt therefore fullie reſolue, that the euerlaſting Sonne of God, who is in the boſome of the father, was ſent a legate vnto vs, and taking our fleſhe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him was annointed with the ſpirit of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power, that he might cleerely and fully laie open vnto vs, that ſame euerlaſting Counſel of entring into league and couenaunt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13841:65"/>
with vs, &amp; might declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame good and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable will of God towards vs, whereby he hath freely choſen vs to himſelf in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, and might frame vs to true ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, &amp; to beleue the Goſpel: yea might alſo confirme his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by miracles, as by healing the blind, by raiſing vp the dead &amp;c, which neither the diuel nor anie creature can followe. That he might alſo adioyne the ſacramentes as holy ſignes to the renewed couenaunt, to wit baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper. Moreouer, concerning the prieſtlie officie, I thinke it ſo to belong to the couenant: that euen like as the Propheticall office of Chriſt, inſtructeth vs of the couenaunt and of a full reconciliation with God in Chriſt; ſo the prieſtly office goeth further, and offereth vp the verie price of this reconciliation, to wit a perfect ſacrifice with interceſſion, wherby the mediator of Gods righteouſnes doeth perfectly ſatisfie for our ſinnes, which did let and keepe of the couenaunt, and without the clenſing whereof that ſame prophetical ambaſſadge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen had beene taken in vaine to intreate of the couenaunt: ſeeing neither wee can ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for our ſinnes our ſelues, neither would God denie his owne righteouſnes. Laſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that kingly office, forſomuch as it was not enough for a mediator to haue taught vs of the couenaunt, and to haue ſanctified it by the offering vp of his body and bloode, vnleſſe hee likewiſe ſhould defend &amp; maintain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couenant againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſaults of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie, &amp; ſhould throgh his might build vp a people in himſelf day by

For it is mans happines, to be ioyned with God, the fountaine of al goodnes, 1. Ioh. 1. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is the greateſt vnhappineſſe to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God. But man had ſeparated himſelfe by ſinne from God, and had entred into coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the deuill. Euen like as therefore there was a certaine perſon by whom ſinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13841:71"/>
into the world, and by ſinne death, and ſo became as it were the cauſe and foundation of falling away from God, &amp; ending into league with the diuel: ſo alſo muſt there be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſon appointed of God, that might be the foundation and cauſe of reconciliation, and of neuer breaking that ſame coniunction with God, the fountaine of all happineſſe. Now this perſon is the euerlaſting ſonne of God, with all the proprieties of the diuine nature, and very man, with all the proprieties of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And euen like as there muſt both theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, true and ſound, the proprieties of either being kept in one perſon of Chriſt to reconcile man to God, and to ſtrike this couenant: ſo alſo to kepe this couenant, that according to the promiſe &amp; oath of God it may be euerlaſting, both natures muſt remaine for euer ſound with their proprieties, vnleſſe we will haue the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in the verie piller and foundation to be ſhaken.

                     <p>THe end of once taking &amp; neuer putting off againe mans nature, was that God might declare his vnchangeable righteouſnes and wrath againſt ſinne, and his mercie towardes vs. His iuſtice, I ſay, and his wrath whileſt he will not ſo make his couenant, that he be found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and a lyer, who had truely and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly pronounced: in what day ſoeuer you ſhall eate of that tree, you ſhall die the death. And Pſal. 5. Thou art not a God that wilt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. Therefore he puniſhed ſinne, in the fleſh of man, yea in the fleſh of his onely begotten ſonne: that his high and vnchangeable righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, truth, and wrath againſt ſinne, might be manifeſt to the whole worlde: His mercy, whileſt he puniſheth not our ſins in our ſelues, which notwithſtanding he might iuſtly do, but deriueth his wrath vpon his onely begotten ſonne, that he might in very deede declare his infinite mercy towardes vs. Therefore wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and with great wiſedome, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy of God do meete and agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or rather that ſame loue towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde in Chriſt Ieſu. I will ſpeake more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the matter may be more euident. God going about to enter into couenant with man, or willing to reconcile man euerlaſtingly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13841:72"/>
himſelf, wold yet ſo ſhew his mercie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not his righteouſnes, which is eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial vnto him, &amp; which he can no more denie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he can denie himſelf. Now the ſeuere &amp; exact righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of God required y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foraſmuch as corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tranſgreſſion cleaued in mans nature, that is to ſay both in our ſoule and bodie: ſo alſo in the ſame, that is in the nature of man taken of the ſonne of God, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſubſtance, and like in all thinges vnto vs (ſinne onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which neither belongeth to the ſubſtance nor to the properties of man as he was created of God) there ſhould be a ſatiſfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. For like as by one man ſinne hath entred into the worlde (as the Apoſtle ſaith to the Rom. cap. 5.) and by ſinne death, and ſo death hath paſſed vpon all men, in as much as al haue ſinned: and as by the diſobedience of one man manie are made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one many are made righteous. Alſo. If by the ſinne of that one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift through grace, which is of one man Ieſus Chriſt, hath abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes many. Wherefore Chriſt muſt be very man both in ſoule &amp; bodie, who by obedience euen to death, and to the death of the croſſe, might ſatiſfie the vnchangable righteouſnes of God, who would not puniſhe that in Angels, becauſe men had ſinned, but in the verie nature of man, therefore the ſonne of God tooke not Angels, but the ſeede of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, the very nature of man of the ſeede of Abraham. Heb. 2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it behoued the mediator of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13841:73"/>
couenant to bee brotherlie affected towardes vs, and therefore he muſt be our verie brother in deede, and abide ſo for euer, with all the proprieties of a verie brother in deede, as is plainely taught in the ſecond chap. to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues: He that ſanctifieth, and they which are ſanctified are al of one. For which cauſe he was not aſhamed to cal them brethren, ſaying, I will declare thy name vnto my brethren: in the middeſt of the Church I will ſing praiſes vnto thee. And that we may knowe, that like as the Sonne of God was not aſhamed, to become once our brother, with brotherly affection, &amp; other verie humaine properties: ſo alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is not now aſhamed of vs, neither that he hath put off nature or affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and other very properties of man, and of a brotherly nature, the Scripture ſaith in the end of the Chapter. Wherfore in al things it behoued him to be made like vnto his brethren, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might be merciful &amp; a faithfull hie prieſt in thinges which were to be don with God, that he might make reconciliation for the ſinns of the people. For in that he ſuffered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was tempted, he is able to ſuccour them which are tempted. And leaſt any man ſhould cauil, that Chriſt after his aſcenſion into heauen bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be aſhamed of vs, and to put off the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a brother, that is that verie nature of man, and the properties thereof: Heare what the ſpirite of trueth ſaith farther in 4. cap. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Epiſtle. Hauing therfore an high prieſt which hath entred into the heauens, euen Ieſus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnne of God, let vs hold faſt our profeſſion. For we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13841:73"/>
haue not an high Prieſt, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in al thinges tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne. Let vs therfore go with confidence (now he ſet the foundation of confidence to be in this, that we haue an highe Biſhop, who not onely hath the nature of God, but alſo of man, a very bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in deed, hauing not put of the properties of nature, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can haue compaſſion vpon vs) to the throne of grace, that we may obtaine mercy and finde grace to helpe in the time of neede.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God hath confirmed by oath, that the fruite of the loines of Dauid, ſhould raigne for euer. Pſal. 133. and the 89.

                     <p>THe cauſes for which it is neceſſarie that the mediator be not onely very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God, be theſe. The chiefe cauſe is, becauſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13841:74"/>
God would declare his infinite loue. And this is the meaning of that, So God loued the worlde (ſo I ſay) that he gaue his only begotten ſonne, &amp;c. The ſecond cauſe is next vnder this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had receaued a commandement of the father, that required an almightie worker (to wit a commandement, by his merite and vertue to ſaue the elect.) Nowe there is but one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, euen God. Ioh. 10. verſ. 18. Out of this ſame ſecond cauſe, which properly belongeth to Chriſt, theſe endes are deriued: The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning deſarte. For therefore muſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor be verie God, that, that ſame obedience of Chriſt, whereby ſo great a perſon, which is equal to the father, humbling himſelfe in the nature of man, that the curſe might be made in it, might be from the beginning of the world for al eternitie to come a matchable price, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a price of redemption for the ſinnes of all the elect of the whole worlde, euen that the price might wey downe our ſinnes. Therefore in the 20. of the Actes it is ſaide, <hi>That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his Church with his bloud.</hi> And in the 9 to the Hebrues, Alſo, <hi>grace hath abounded aboue the fault.</hi> This obedience of the Sonne when it is made a ſacrifice for vs, it ſurmounteth all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Angels, and al other creatures.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond end is, that ſeeing he muſt be a Sauiour, no leſſe in vertue then in merite: he muſt firſt in himſelfe ouercome our ſinne, the wrath of God and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nowe that the waight of the infinite wrath of God in the manhoode might ſtand &amp; ouercome, and moreouer that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13841:74"/>
he might raiſe himſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that ſhould ſuffer, ſhould be very man in ſuch ſort, that he might together be infinite, that is the true and euerlaſting God: that is, that his manhod ſhould be perſonallie &amp; inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perablie vnited to his godheade, of which it ſhould vpholden, that our ſaluation might not by any meane be in danger, ſeeing it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnion ſhould be diſſolued. For God alone could not die (as one of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers haue wittilie ſaid) neither could man alone ouercome death. Therefore to the Romans Ca. 1. he ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is declared to be the ſonne of God by the power of his reſurrection. Moreouer by his power, it behoued him alſo to ouercome ſinne and death in vs (Ioh. 5.) to witte by giuing faith, whereby that merite might be applied vnto vs, and the holy Ghoſte through, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might reſtore in vs the image of God, and quicken vs euerlaſtingly, and alſo maintaine that ſaluation ſo gotten: Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as all theſe things are of nature belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to him who is almightie, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that he by nature ſhould be God almightie.

Now when we ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the diuine and humaine nature of Chriſte are perſonallie knit together, we vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne who is God, hath taken mans nature into the vnitie of his perſon, and ſo God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh, and made man, but in the perſon of the ſonne, and ſo as the proprieties of both natures remaine ſafe, aſwel that the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men might be obtained by that meane, that he had appointed: as alſo that it might be maintained and continued for euer. For ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not haue ben obtained, vnleſſe mans nature, and the nature of God had bene knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a perſonall vnion: Firſt, becauſe it had not beene the bloude of the Sonne of God, that was to be ſhed: and ſo it had not

bene a ſacrifice worthie enough, for the ſinnes of the whole worlde. Moreouer, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie could not haue beene able to ſuſtaine the wrath of God, neither haue aboliſhed the ſinnes that were laide vpon it, vnleſſe the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie had ben coupled vnto it, into the vnitie of the perſon, by a moſt firme and altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſeable knotte: both which, that ſame man Chriſt by the power of his diuinitie, being perſonally knitte vnto him, hath perfourmed. Acts 20. Philip. 2. Hebr. 19.14. Coloſſ. 1. verſ. 14.15. And much leſſe alſo might ſaluation nowe obtained be maintained, vnleſſe they were knit together, and might ſo remaine for euer. For euen like as it was required for the entry to that prieſthoode, and for the prouiding of full ſatiſfaction, that there ſhould be the body and ſoule of the ſonne of God, in which there might be ſatiſfaction: ſo alſo that the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode might be euerlaſting, and an euerlaſting interceſſion be made for vs, it muſt be, that that ſame humane nature be properly belonging to the ſonne of God, which he muſt ſhewe before the face of the father in heauen, in which, as our ſinnes are once cleanſed, ſo it might be the pledge of our reconciliation for euer. Pſal. 110.1. and the 4. Matth. 22. verſ 44. Moreouer that ſame man Chriſt, could not by his vertue and power be a ſauiour, vnleſſe alſo he had the diuine nature ioyned vnto him, into the vnitie of perſon, from which, together as alſo from the father proceedeth the holy ghoſte, who bringeth vs into the poſſeſſion of Chriſt, engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth

                     </head>
                     <p>THE firſt fruite is, that the obedience of Chriſt is our righteouſnes before God. For in the death of Chriſt faith ſpecially loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon that ſame voluntarie, and ſpeciall obedience of the ſonne, whereby he was made obediente to the father, euen to the death, and to the death of the croſſe: Philip. 2.8. Hebr. 5.8. And therefore euen as by the diſobedience of one man, manie were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one righteous, many are made righteous. Rom. 5. And becauſe by his death he iuſtifieth vs from our ſinnes, through which the diuell gotte the power of death, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith that the ſonne of God through death aboliſhed him, that had the power of death, that is the diuel, &amp; ſet free, as manie as through the feare of death through all their life were ſubiect to bondage. Heb. 2. Therefore in this article, there is contayned this promiſe, which I take by faith, that Chriſt died for my ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt, that I clothed through faith with this obedience, might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed righteous before God. And ſurely when Iſay in the 53. chap. had largely ſet forth that ſame willing obedience of the death of Chriſt, as a lambe not opening his mouth, after wardes he expreſſely ſetteth foorth in the ſame being laid hold on by faith, our iuſtification in theſe wordes: My righteous ſeruaunt by his knowledge ſhall iuſtifie manie, becauſe he ſhall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13841:83"/>
beare their ſinnes. Certainly it muſt needes be, that the voluntarie paſſion and death of the ſon of God be an excellent thing, ſeeing that there are not ſo many &amp; ſo euident propheſies of any thing, as of that, ſo that there was no day paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the ſame in a figure, as in a viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, to wit, in that continuall ſacrifice mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, was ſet before the eyes; and ſeeing without the ſhedding of bloode there coulde be no remiſſion, it muſt of neceſſitie be a moſt precious thing; and ſeeing S. Peter ſaith, that the Prophets haue enquired and ſearched, when or what time, that ſame forewitnes, which was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame ſpirit of Chriſt in them, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſufferinges that ſhould come vnto Chriſt, and the glorie that ſhoulde followe. 1. Pet. 1.11.19.20. Nowe the worthines of this obedience euen to the death, hangeth vppon the worthines of the perſon, for that ſo great a perſon, to wit, as the ſonne of God, who was in the forme of God, was made ſo far foorth obedient in his humaine nature, that hee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to vndergoe that ſame curſſed death v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croſſe. By theſe it is plaine that this is the firſt fruit of the death of Chriſt, that hee might be our righteouſnes before God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that thing be vndoubtedly determined of vs, wee doe not worthily enough eſteeme the precious death of the ſonne of God.</p>

For euen as when the hearte of a man hath receaued a deadly wounde, he is as one for dead, becauſe he cannot eſcape death: euen ſo ſinne hath receaued a deadly wounde in Chriſt, ſo as we are ſaide to be dead in Chriſt. Rom 6. And ſo the Lord ſpeaketh in Hoſee the Prophet cap. 13.

                     <p>BVrial is a part of the humiliation of Chriſt. For it is the proceeding of his death. The firſt fruit therefore of this article is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our faith, that wee doubte not, Chriſt being deade in deede and buried for vs, that he was ſo farre foorth humbled, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death nor buriall can hurte vs, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the wrath of the father is truely and and indeede pacified. For euen like as Ionah, who was a figure of Chriſt, being once caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Which thing foraſmuch as Chriſt the mediatour of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt, hath in deede fulfilled, as is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this article, wee doe worthilie beleeue it. And this in deede is the firſte fruite of Chriſt his buriall. The ſeconde: This article alſo maketh to repentaunce and amendement of life. For like as Chriſt deade by ſinne, reſteth in the graue: ſo wee by the vertue of that communion, which wee haue with Chriſt deade and buried, wee ought altogether to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme our olde man by the power of faith, and by the teſtimonie of Baptiſme, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together with Chriſt, that true reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to our conſciences, wee maye reſt from our workes, that is from our ſinnes, and ſo beginne heere that euerlaſting Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth vntill by the vertue of Chriſte, it bee fully accompliſhed in vs. So Paule when hee ſayde in the 6. to the Romanes, that wee are baptiſed into the death of Chriſt, hee by and by addeth, that wee are alſo buried with Chriſt by baptiſme into death: to witte, that hee might expreſſe, that by the vertue of that communion wee haue with Chriſte, it is brought to paſſe, in a continuall courſe and proceeding that wee mortifie our olde man.

                        <hi>Of the falſe vnderstanding of this article,</hi> where alſo is entreated of Lymbus, and of the firſt beginning of the error thereof.</head>
                     <p>THat it followeth in the Creede that Chriſte deſcended into hell, ſhal we ſay that it hath hath this ſenſe: that Chriſt deſcended into Lymbus, in which place there is neither ioie nor ſorrowe, that he might deliuer the fathers from thence; or els that he deſcended into the place of the damned? No, not ſo. For firſt it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the fathers alſo before the death of Chriſt had ioye and comfort, as it appeareth Luk. 16. in Abraham and Lazarus. Beſides that the word Hell is not taken for Lymbus in any place of the ſcripture. Nowe the beginning of the error concerning Lymbus, is that many thought and yet doe thinke, that ſinnes were not forgiuen before that Chriſt ſuffered. And the paſſion of Chriſt had his effect and power from euerlaſting. For Chriſt yeſterday and to day, for euer and the ſame world without end. Hebr. 13.8. And Paule to the Romanes 4. defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iuſtification by Dauid: Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiuen. Therefore in the time of Dauid, before Chriſt had ſuffered, ſinnes were forgiuen by confidence and truſt in that ſacrifice of Chriſt to come. And in the ſame Chapter he ſaith, that we obtaine happines and remiſſion of ſinnes by no other meanes, then whereby Abraham obtained it who is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all beleeuers. So Math. 8. Many ſhall
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13841:87"/>
come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhal ſit with Abraham, Iſaack, and Iacob, in the kingdome of Heauen. Seeing therefore that this ſame errour preuaileth againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Fathers had not remiſſion of ſinnes before Chriſt ſuffred, from thence ſprang this other errour concerning Lymbus. For it was too harde to thruſt the fathers downe into hel: becauſe as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, there is no rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of hel: &amp; to place them in euerlaſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, they duſt not: becauſe Chriſt hauing not yet ſuffered, they thought their ſinnes were not yet forgiuen. They found out therfore a middle place, in which there was neither felicitie nor ſorrowe, which in the ſchooles they called Lymbus, as if they ſhould ſay the porch of hell. And ſo the diuell endeuoured to darken the greatnes of the efficacie of Chriſtes ſacrifice, whiles he denied that the Fathers had remiſſion of ſinnes in the olde Teſtament by faith in the ſacrifice to come: and therefore he deuiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Lymbus: euen like as hee faigned Purgatorie for thoſe faithful ones, who were dead after the ſuffering of Chriſt. That to the ſame ende alſo the power of cleanſing from ſinnes might be withdrawen from the paſſion of Chriſte, againſt the manifeſt worde of God. I. Iohn. 1.7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither is it to be ſuffered in any caſe, that we ſay that Chriſte deſcended into hell, that is to the place of the damned, that there he ſhould ouercome death, and the diuel for vs, or that he ſhould ſuffer any newe tormentes, for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13841:87"/>
that he both ouercame Sathan, by his death, and after death ſuffered no more ſorrowes by which he ſhould deliuer vs from the power of Sathan, the Epiſtle to the Hebrues doth witnes chapter 2. That he might by death aboliſh him which had the power of death y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the diuel, &amp; might ſet as many free as by the feare of death throgh al their life were ſubiect vnto bondage, Alſo to the Coloſſ. 2.14.15. And Luke the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt witneſſeth that he deliuered vp his ſpirite to the keeping of his father. Neither can it fitly be taken of the ſhewing forth of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie of Chriſt in hell, for that belongeth to that exaltation which at length he began in his reſurrection: nowe the deſcending of Chriſte into hell pertaineth to his humiliation, as Peter expreſſely in the ſecond of the Actes teacheth by Dauid. Theſe thinges many of the auncient fathers more diligently waying, thought that hell was to be taken here ſimply for the graue.

The ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are theſe; hel ſignifieth the graue, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by tranſlation, the place of the damned, thirdly extreame ſorrowes. Pſalme. 18 1. Sam. 2. fourthly it is taken for the condition, which is in buriall and which followeth the ſame; or els for that ſame ful ſtate of extreame ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to wit, whiles they that are buried, lie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and as it were ſwallowed vp of death, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias 14.11.15.16.17. Of the firſt ſignification we haue ſaide, why the deſcenſion into hell muſt not be taken ſimplie for burial in this place. The other ſignification alſo to wit, the deſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the place of the damned, we haue ſhewed not to agree to this article. There remaineth two ſignifications, to wit, the ſorrowes of mind and that ſame ſtate or condition, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe ſorrowes and burying it ſelfe. In the firſt ſignification Chriſte in his whole paſſion, not onely in his bodie, but in his ſoule eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie felt thoſe ſame horrible anguiſhes which Peter calleth the ſorrowes of death, Actes 2. In the verie entrance of this moſt feareful bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les pit the voice of Chriſt doth witnes this very thing, Matth. 26. <hi>My ſoule is heauie vnto death:</hi> in the proceeding into the ſame bottomleſſe gulfe, the droppes of bloud doe alſo witneſſe a greater anguiſh of the minde, which fell from his face vpon the earth, Luke 22. And from the verie bottome of this gulfe proceeded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> voice
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13841:88"/>
of Chriſt witneſſing his extreame torments: <hi>O God my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> Matth. 27. In verie deede becauſe we haue not onely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in bodie but principallie alſo in ſoule and deſerued the wrath of God: it behoued our pledge Chriſt, before that righteous tribunall ſeate of God to feele the wrath of God not only in bodie, but alſo in ſoule, and to appeaſe it, that he might be the redeemer not onely of the bodie, but alſo of the ſoule. 1. Cor. 6.20. Of whih matter there is a notable place to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues Cap. 5. verſ. 7. Who (that is to ſay Chriſt) in the dayes of his fleſh did offer vp prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and teares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that was able to ſaue him from death, and was alſo heard in that which he feared, and though he were the ſonne, yet learned he obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the thinges which he ſuffred, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſecrated was made the author of eternal ſaluation vnto all them that obey: where alſo this is to be obſerued, that the willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt is ſeene in that ſame deſcending of Chriſt. And therefore Saint Peter alſo 1. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cap. 2 calleth Chriſt the Paſtor of ſoules. Nowe although that Chriſt in his paſſion did onely feele theſe ſorrowes of hel for a time, yet notwithſtanding this ſame humiliation of the ſonne of God, into thoſe ſame extreame ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of hell enduring onely for a time, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with thoſe euerlaſting paines, which in ſinning againſt the eternal God, we haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: ſeeing that ſame perſon God is euerlaſting who hath ſo humbled it ſelfe in his humaine
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13841:89"/>
nature, that it felt the ſorrowes of hell. Which alſo is the cauſe why thoſe ſame ſorrowes in Chriſte, could but laſt onely for a time, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the vngodlie lie ouerwhelmed for euer. Neither is there any cauſe why any man ſhould thinke, that theſe thinges which are attributed vnto him of the Euangeliſtes, to wit, heauineſſe, feare, and to conclude, ſorrowe, all which doe ſpring of infirmitie, to be vnmeete for the perſon of Chriſte. Firſt for becauſe Chriſte not for his owne, but for our cauſe tooke theſe thinges vpon him of his owne accorde, and therefore they withdraw nothing from his power and ſtrength. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this infirmitie of Chriſte was pure and free from all ſinne, aſwell becauſe he continued in true obedience, ſo that he ſuffered ſuch great tormentes without any blaſphemie againſt God, as alſo becauſe he left not off, to haue hope in God, admit he were vexed aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when he ceaſed not to call him his God, of whom he cryeth out that he was forſaken. Hebrues. 5. verſes 7.8.9. This ſignification which is the thirde in order, to wit, of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the minde ſpringing from the curſe, doth conteine a profitable and neceſſarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine agreeable with the holie Scripture, and this ſignification were ſufficient for the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this article, ſauing that two pointes doe let, both that in the death of Chriſt which was accurſed thoſe ſame ſorrowes ſpringing from the feeling of the curſe are comprehended, and that ſame article of burying is adioyned. The
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13841:89"/>
later ſignification therefore of hell, is that ſame condition which is in buriall and which followeth the ſame, that is to ſay, whiles they which are buried, lie oppreſſed and as it were ſwallowed vp of death. And therfore Dauid ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Who ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſse thee in the graue?</hi> Pſa. 49.15.16 Eſai 14.11.15.16.17. Chriſt alſo would humble himſelfe euen vnto this ſame verie ſtate, that he might lie vntil the thirde day as Ionah in the bellie of the whale, ſwallowed, and as it were ouercome of death. For ſo the Scripture ſpeaketh of Ionah, the figure of Chriſte praying out of the bellie of the fiſhe. Chapter 2. verſe 2. In my affliction I haue called vpon the Lord, and he hath heard me, from the bellie of hell haue I called vpon thee, and thou haſt hearde my voice. And in the fourth verſe, But I haue ſaide I am caſt away from thy ſight, yet I will looke towardes the temple of thy holineſſe. And verſe 6. the barres of the earth haue ſhutte me in for euer. Saint Peter ioyneth both ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications together in one &amp; the ſame verſe Actes 2. ſaying, Whom God raiſed vp looſing the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of death, becauſe it was impoſſible that he ſhould be holden of it. For firſt in thoſe wordes, thoſe ſame ſorrowes of death without all controuerſie, are thoſe ſame extreame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes not onely of the bodie but principally of the minde, wherwith God would bruſe him, Eſaie. 53. and in which he being ſet and placed he crieth out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> Moreouer Peter addeth that then thoſe ſame ſorrowes of death were looſed, when God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13841:90"/>
raiſed him vp from the dead, becauſe that it was impoſſible that he ſhould be holden of it: in which wordes he manifeſtly ioyneth that ſtate which followed the ſorrowes of death, and the burial with the ſorrowes themſelues. And why ſo? For although the bodie lying in the graue were voide of all ſorrowe and of all ſenſe and feeling (when Chriſt was truely, and in deede dead) notwithſtanding ſeeing that death it ſelfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ch was continued in the graue, ſeemed to be nothing elſe, but as it were the victorie &amp; ful triumph ouer thoſe ſame ſorrowes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chriſt is then worthily ſaide to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome thoſe ſame deadly and deſperate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, (which are truely the ſorrowes of hell) when being dead he ouercame death, that he with his might liue euerlaſtingly with God. Seeing therefore that it is certaine, that Peter entreateth there of the extreameſt degree of the humiliation of Chriſt, it followeth that by his deſcending into hell, there is noted not onely the ſorrowes of death, but alſo that extreame ſhame, as the victorie of ſorrowes, whiles being holden in the graue euen vntill the thirde day, he lay as it were oppreſſed of death. Eſaie 53. ver. 8. And in verie deed although Chriſt were greatly humbled vpon the croſſe, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the enemies as one forlorne of God, and alſo cried out that he was forſaken of God: yet notwithſtanding their minde was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, neither had their rage and madnes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Sathans ben ſatiſfied, vnleſſe hee had lien wholy ſhut vp and oppreſſed in the graue,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13841:90"/>
and ſo had bene holden of death. They ſhewe that ſame diſcontentednes, Let him come down from the croſſe, and we will beleeue in him: and albeit they doe ſo triumph ouer him, whiles Chriſt truely felt thoſe ſorrowes of hell, (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he witneſſeth the ſame by his voice) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was but halfe the triumph of Satan, or as it were euen begon. For euen they by whome Sathan had triumphed ouer Chriſte as forſaken of God and nowe oppreſſed, they were doubtful &amp; careful to continue the ſame victorie, and therefore deſire that the ſepulchre may be kept, and they alſo ſet their ſeale vpon it. Matth. 27, verſe 62.63. And why doe they this thing? euen becauſe they ſawe that it ſhould be an imperfect or rather no victorie, vnleſſe alſo after burial the poſſeſſion of victorie might be continued, that is the cutting off of Meſſias as one altogether forſaken of God. Daniel in the 9. Chapter ſeemeth to haue expreſſed this great humiliation of the ſonne of God: <hi>The Meſſias ſhalbe cut off, and there ſhal be none to wit, that ſhal helpe him, he ſhalbe vtterly forſaken.</hi> yea whiles he doth not onely foreſhewe that, but alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheweth an other, that it ſhal come to paſſe that he wil eſtabliſh his couenant: and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Chapter, that he may eſtabliſh an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome, hee plainely prophecieth, that hee ſhall after that extreame abaſing of him ſelfe riſe againe a victorious Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

at length Chriſtes victorie ſhalbe perfect, and the deliueraunce from hell in his members, when he ſhall alſo deliuer their bodies, out of that vile eſtate in which they lie buried (for they are ſowen in diſhonour, verſe 42.) &amp; ſhall ioyne them vnto their ſoules: <hi>When this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſubiect to corruption ſhal put on</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>an incorrupt nature, and this mortal ſhal put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, then ſhalbe fulfilled that which is written, Death is ſwallowed vp in victorie, O death, where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie!

So alſo as long as death and the graue helde Chriſt dead, and as it were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, ſo long continued their power ouer him: nowe the ſame is fullie taken from him when he aroſe from the dead. Laſtly the very order it ſelfe of the articles themſelues ſhewe that by the deſcending of Chriſt into hell, there is noted that ſame extreame ignominie which followed his buriall, the which thing alſo is manifeſt by the antitheſis or contrarie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Chriſte his exaltation.

Nowe Paules ſermon is on this ſorte, Men and brethren, you ſonnes of the ſtocke of Abraham, and thoſe amongest you that feare God, to you is this worde of ſaluation ſent. For the inhabitantes of Jeruſalem and their rulers, becauſe they knewe him not, nor yet the wordes of the prophetes which are read euery Sabboth day, they haue fulfilled them in condemning him, and though they found no cauſe of death in him yet deſired they Pilate to kill him. And when they had fulfilled all thinges which were written of him, they put him beeing taken downe from the tree into a ſepulchre, but God raiſed him from the dead, and he was ſeene many daies of them, which came vp with him from Galile to Hieruſalem which are his witneſses vnto the people. And we preach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that touching the promiſe made vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, God hath fulfilled it vnto vs their children, in that he raiſed vp Ieſus, euen as it is written in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pſalme, Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee.

Wherefore he ſaith alſo in an other place, Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.

                     <p>THe vſe or fruite whereof we be partakers of the reſurrection of Chriſt is fourefold. The firſt is that the reſurrection of Chriſte is a publike teſtimonie, that by the Meſſias, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel ſpeaketh, there is brought a perfect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting righteouſnes vpon all and ouer all that doe beleeue. For ſeeing that he is deade not in his owne but in our ſinnes that were laide vpon him, and that out of them he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen againe to a life that ſhall neuer die, hence there ſhineth to the mindes of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers a wonderfull light, that not ſo much as one of all their ſinnes remained vnwaſhed or vnſatiſfied. For if ſo be that there had remained but one of all their ſinnes, which (none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſte tooke vpon him) either not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly puniſhed, or imperfectly puniſhed:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13841:95"/>
then could not Chriſt our pledge and truce-maker riſe againe: for aſmuch as where there is but one ſinne, there of neceſſitie muſt death be: for ſo hath the vnchangeable trueth, and righteouſnes of God decreed, Rom. 6. <hi>The wages of ſinne is death.</hi> Neither yet doth the reſurrection of Chriſt ſo make to our iuſtification, as it is onely a publike teſtimonie thereof: but alſo in a more highe conſideration, and that ſound &amp; perfect, euerie manner of waie, to wit that that ſame raiſing vp of the Sonne, is (as I may ſay) an actual remiſſion from the ſinnes of all them which beleeue. For euen as the Father by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering Chriſt to death, hath in deede condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our ſinnes in Chriſt, Rom. 8. verſe 3. ſo alſo by raiſing him from death, he hath in the ſame deed abſolued Chriſt from our ſinnes and vs in Chriſt. There is a moſt ſure demonſtration of this doctrine in the 1. Cor. 15. If Chriſt (ſaith he) be not riſen againe, in vaine is our faith, &amp; ye are yet in your ſinnes, that is to ſay, ye are yet guiltie before God. Therefore becauſe Chriſt is ariſen, we are not any longer in our ſinnes, that is, we are in very deede abſolued from them, in this very thing that the father hath raiſed him from the dead, that they might not be laide to our charge. 2. Cor. 5.19. So alſo is that ſame place to be taken. Ro. 4. For it was written, not for Abraham alone, for that this was imputed vnto him, but alſo for vs, to whome it ſhoulde come to paſſe that it ſhould be imputed, that is to ſay, to them which beleue
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13841:95"/>
in him who hath raiſed vp our Lorde Ieſus from the dead, who was deliuered for our ſinnes, &amp; raiſed vp againe for our iuſtification. What hath the father done by deliuering Chriſt to death? He hath deliuered him for our ſinnes, he hath puniſhed our ſinnes in him. And what hath he done by raiſing him vp? He hath iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all in him: for when he had deliuered him, that is the beleeuers, ſo that their ſins ſhal be no more laide to their charge, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes ſhall be imputed vnto them. For theſe wordes <hi>raiſed vp for our iustification,</hi> are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of imputation, as by this it is eaſie to bee ſeene, becauſe that in the laſt verſe ſauing one he hath ſaide that righteouſnes is imputed of him <hi>who hath raiſed him vp,</hi> and in this laſte verſe he nameth it our iuſtification in him who is raiſed vppe. Loe that which before he had called imputation of righteouſnes, this hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth now our iuſtification. What, for that the ſame Apoſtle in the 1. Timoth. 3. ſaith, And without controuerſie great is the myſterie of godlineſſe, God manifeſted in the fleſh iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpirite, ſeene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, beleued on in the world, &amp; receyued vp into glorie: doth he not manifeſtly ſhewe that that ſame true God who was manifeſted in the fleſhe wherein alſo he ſuffered: by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite which he oppoſeth againſt the fleſhe, that is by the power of his owne diuinitie whereby he raiſed vp the fleſhe from the deade, was iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and that not from his owne ſinnes, but from ours which he had taken vppon him? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

which raiſing vp and iuſtification of him their folowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimonie of Angels, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publike preaching of the remiſſion of ſins through him vnto the gentiles, the beleefe which was giuen vnto him, and to be ſhort the receiuing of him vp into glorie: all which teſtimonies verely coulde not haue followed, vnleſſe he had beene iuſtified from our ſinnes, by riſing againe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the power of his diuinitie. For neither coulde the Angels giue witnes of him as of the Sauiour if he had remained oppreſſed in our condemnation: neither remiſſion of ſinnes haue ben preched in his name, if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our name he had not beene fully iuſtified: neither faith haue bene giuen to him, if oppreſſed of ſinne &amp; death he could not haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy goſt, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of faith: neither could he haue ben receiued vp into glory vnleſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame fleſh, vpon which all our ſinnes had beene caſt (Eſay 53.) had beene iuſtified from them, when it was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp from death, to which by the counſaile of death it was condemned. This is that ſame power of the reſurrection of Chriſt, whereby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes which is not of the lawe, but the righteouſnes which is of God, is brought forth through faith, concerning which Paul Phil. 3. in an vndoubted and full perſuaſion of faith, glorieth after this manner: as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes which is in the lawe, I was blameleſſe, but the things which were vantage vnto mee, thoſe things I accounted loſſe, in reſpect of Chriſt, yea doubtles I thinke all things loſſe for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſte Ieſus my Lorde, for whom I depriue my ſelfe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13841:96"/>
of al theſe things, &amp; accoumpt them for doung, that I may gaine Chriſt, and may be founde in in him not hauing my righteouſnes which is of the lawe, but that which is of Chriſt through faith, the righteouſnes which is of GOD through faith, that I may knowe him, &amp; the force and power of his reſurrection. Therefore alſo Paul, Rom. 8. not onely oppoſeth death as the price and redemption againſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation but alſo of the reſurrection as the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and as it were a higher degree. For ſo he ſaith, <hi>Who is it that ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt which is deade, or rather which is riſen againe.</hi> Why alſo doth Peter recken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt to be the couenaunt of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience: vnleſſe it be becauſe then the conſcience is clere and reſtored into libertie, when that ſame light of iuſtification in the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt ſhall ſhine vnto it? Therefore then at length the couenaunt of Baptiſme is ratified in beleeuers, when faith ſhall haue obtayned this victorie in our heartes, ſee the 1. Pet. 3 And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto maketh that ſame courſe and order of propounding the Goſpell, which the Apoſtles kept in the Actes, to witte, why they ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, that hee whome they had crucified, was raiſed vp againe from the deade, and why they ſet out in him being raiſed vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deade, iuſtification or rather forgiuenes of ſins: to wit, becauſe as our ſins are conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in the death of Chriſt: ſo our abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in his reſurrection: Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul Act. 13. ſhewed forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt, and proued his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by many

reaſons, at the length he concludeth, Brethren, be it therefore knowen vnto you, that through this man is preached vnto you, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and from all thinges from which you coulde not be iuſtified by the lawe of Moſes, by him euerie one that beleeueth is iuſtified. And thoſe ſame wordes that went before, doe ſhewe that Paul doth gather that ſame conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion concerning iuſtification, not onely of the death, but alſo of the reſurrection of Chriſt, which wordes are in this ſort, Wee alſo preach vnto you the ſame promiſe, which was made vnto the fathers, which God hath fulfilled vnto their children, that is to ſay to you, hauing rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp Ieſus. And ſurely that ſame courſe or maner of propounding of the Goſpel, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the commaundement. For why, by the commandement of Chriſt was the full goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſent at length after the reſurrection, to the gentiles and to euerie creature, as Chriſte ſaith in Luke: For ſo it behooued that Chriſt ſhoulde ſuffer and riſe againe from the dead the thirde day, and remiſſion of ſinnes be preached in his name to all nations: to wit becauſe then at the length theſe things might be fullie pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his name, after he had borne our ſinnes in his body vppon the tree, and had riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine being iuſtified from them. For then was the Goſpell full all manner of wayes, (1. Cor. 15.1.2.17.) and the grace of iuſtification moſt full and abounding ouer euerie fault in all and ouer all that do beleeue. The ſumme therefore of the firſt fruit of the reſurrection of Chriſt,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13841:97"/>
is that our ſinnes can no more bee laide to our charge then to Chriſte himſelfe: and that in Chriſt we are accounted as righteous and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as Chriſt was when he roſe from the dead. Foraſmuch as by his death going before, hee had taken away our ſinnes through obedience, nowe hereof it followeth ſeeing he aroſe iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, who before as a ſinner was condemned, &amp; accurſſed of God in our perſon, that hee was iuſtified in our name from our ſinnes. Neither is there any cauſe, that any man ſhoulde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that Chriſt by riſing from the deade, was iuſtified from our ſinnes, and we in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were borne, foraſmuch as the Apoſtle ſaith 2. Tim. 1. that that ſame grace was giuen vnto vs before all worldes, but manifeſted in the ſon and yet alſo manifeſted in the Goſpell, ſee alſo Epheſ. 1.</p>

For euen like as hee coulde not haue riſen into life, if there had but one of our ſinnes remayned vnſatisfied for, and vnleſſe all beleuers had ben iuſtified in him, whoſe perſon

Now both theſe benefites are freely giuen vs of the father for Chriſt, into whom whileſt he doth engraft vs by his holy ſpirit, firſt he couereth our ſinnes by the imputation of the perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and ſatiſfaction of Chriſt, then he doth further begin in vs by the ſame ſpirit that ſame newe obedience, which is an vndoubted

teſtimony of our engraffement into Chriſte, and therefore of the forgiuenes of ſinnes, Rom. 8. in the beginning of the Chapiter. For the free couenant of God doth containe theſe two partes, as may be ſeene in the 31. Chapiter of Ieremy. And hereof it commeth to paſſe that it is euerlaſting: becauſe both he writeth his lawe in our heartes, that is, through his ſpirite he beginneth a newe obedience that we depart no more from God. Ieremy 32.40. and becauſe that being vnperfect, he will remember our ſinnes no more. Where theſe two are, there is ſure friendſhippe, a conſtant and euerlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</p>

For the God of Abraham of Iſaak, and of Iacob, who is alſo our God, is not the GOD of the liuing, but of the deade, like as Chriſt himſelfe proueth the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the couenant.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13841:127"/>
the qualities, there is a great diuerſitie, and ſo is that ſame voice of Chriſte to be vnderſtoode, Matth. 22. that in the reſurrection we ſhal bee as the Angels of God in heauen. And Chriſt ſaith, Matthewe 13. Then the righteous ſhall ſhine as the ſunne. For this cauſe the bodies of the faithfull are called clarified bodies, of the clearenes of the heauenlie light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are enlightened: and they are called glorious bodies, of that ſame glory which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that ſame clearenes, (as in the face of Moſes) &amp; ſpiritual bodies of the ſpirit of Chriſt by which they are quickened &amp; bewtified, not to returne againe to nothing. Now the cauſe of this our glorious reſurrection is ſet forth in the third fruite of the reſurrection of Chriſte. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the bodies of the wicked ſhall alſo riſe againe, as I ſhewed before when I ſette foorth the foundations of the reſurrection. And Paule expreſſeth this: Actes 24. But in a condition and qualitie diuerſe from the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For infirmitie, ſhame, corruption and miſery ſhall not be taken from the bodies of the vngodly: but like as they riſe in ſhame, ſo by the iudgement and power of God they ſhalbee confirmed in ſhame and corruption: ſo that they ſhalbe made immortall and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible in corruption and death it ſelfe, not to bee conſumed with any tormentes, but as it were hot burning yron, they ſhall burne for euer, Daniel 12.

                     <p>THE meaning is: I beleeue that the ſame life which is in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo in mee: Coloſſ. 3. Your life is hid with Chriſt in God When Chriſt our life ſhall be made manifeſt, then ſhall you alſo be made manifeſt in glorie. The name of euerlaſting life comprehendeth in it all that ſame happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gladneſſe both of ſoule and body, which the ſoules enioye by and by after this
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13841:128"/>
life through Ieſus Chriſte, and which alſo the bodies ioyned to the ſoules ſhall enioye with them, when they ſhall be taken vp into the aire that they may bee alwayes with the Lorde. 1. Theſſ. 4. I confeſſe not onely this euerlaſting life: but I truſt that it is prepared &amp; proper to me. Chriſt confirmeth this prorietie and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling begun thereof, which a ful fruition ſhall follow, ſaying, Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, he that heareth my wordes and beleeueth on him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhal not come into iudgement, but he hath paſſed from death to life. Iohn. 5. verſ. 24 The Apoſtle out of the Prophete Eſay. 1. Cor. 1. doeth ſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe out the full fruition and the enioying thereof, as which can not be comprehended by any thought or vnderſtanding in this life, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the eye hath not ſeene &amp;c. There is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble picture of it in the Apocalips, chapter 21. where amongeſt other thinges he ſaith, I haue not ſeene a temple in it: for the omnipotent Lorde is the temple thereof, that is the lambe. Neither doeth this citie neede ſunne or moone to ſhine in it. For the glorie of God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened it, and the lambe is the light thereof. For God to whome in Chriſte wee ſhall then bee ſo fully ioyned and knit as the fountaine of all goodnes, that beyond him there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be deſired, to the ende wee might bee truelie happie, as hee ſaith to the father of all nations, and ſo to all beleeuers Geneſis 15.

                     <head>The ſcope or vſe of this Article.</head>
                     <p>THe ſcope is that the faithfull may knowe, that their full and ſtayed felicitie is not in this earth, and that he that hath begune his worke in vs, wil alſo perfect it. Of which knowledge there is a threefolde vſe. Firſt the remembrance of our departure hence into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life to that ſame chiefe &amp; high good, will not ſuffer our heartes to bee faſtened here to theſe earthly thinges as the Apoſtle ſayth, 2 Corinthians 5. And therefore we are alwaies of good comforte, and wee knowe, that ſeeing wee are ſtraungers in body, wee are hardely abſent from the Lorde (for wee walke by faith and not ſight) but we truſt and rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to depart out of the body and to goe to dwel with the Lord. And for this cauſe we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour that both dwelling &amp; departing hence we may bee acceptable vnto him. So in the 8. to the Rom. wee our ſelues which haue the firſt fruites of the ſpirite, do grone with our ſelues waiting for the adoption, that is, the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodies. 1. Pet. 1. paſſe the time of your abiding here in feare, hee calleth it an abiding here, but not a dwelling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:13841:129"/>The ſeconde vſe is patience and conſtancie. For this ſame full felicitie is propounded to be beleeued, to this end that the faithfull, when they ſhall marke that ſame taſte of happineſſe, which they feele by the firſt fruites of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſhall perceiue that they are farre of from the full fruition and enioying of it, in reſpecte of the manifold ſtrife which they haue with ſundrie tribulations, which God vſeth as inſtrumentes to mortifie ſinne and to conſerue them to the head Chriſt, they ſhoulde not in the meane ſeaſon be any whit at al diſcouraged, but turning the eyes of their mindes to that ful happines, they ſhould waite with a peaceable minde for the day of the reuelation. For ſo ſaith Chriſt Luke 21. Ye ſhall be hated of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for my name ſake, but an heare of your heade ſhall not periſh; poſſeſſe your ſoules through patience. And 2. Tim. 2. If any man ſtriue, he is not crowned, vnleſſe he ſtriue lawfully.</p>
                     <p>Nowe this ſame ſecond vſe ought ſpecially to arme the miniſters of the worde, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible fortitude againſt the vnthankefulneſſe of the worlde, to which they doe good againſt the will thereof, againſt pinching pouertie, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes, and to be ſhort ſundrie daungers: that if ſo be that the courage of their minde, be ſometimes preſſed downe vnder the burthen of calamities, they remember that that ſame great weight of the glory prepared be put in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſcale of the ballance: which without all doubt ſhall ſo ouerwey it, that it ſhal make that ſame firſt to be moſt light. For this cauſe wee are not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13841:129"/>
ſluggiſh ſaith the Apoſtle 2. Cor. 4. but though our outwarde man periſh, yet the inwarde man is dayly renewed. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, cauſeth vnto vs a far moſt excellent, and an eternall weight of glorie. Let that ſame promiſe alſo brought by the Angel, be alwayes in ſight, which albeit it be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all the faithful, as all are prophetes: yet it ſpecially is directed to miniſters in Daniel cap. 12. And the wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament, and they that turne many to righteouſnes, ſhal ſhine as the ſtarres for euer &amp; euer. Therefore Chriſt alſo ſaith, Your reward is great in heauen. Matth. 5. Let them alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this themſelues which teach others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
                     <p>The thirde vſe is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaintie of perſeuerance in faith: that is to ſay, that we beleeue that the Lord will neuer ſuffer that we ſhall vtterly fall from grace: becauſe he will haue vs to beleeue euerlaſting life. If I muſt beleeue euerlaſting life, I truſt not without cauſe alſo that I ſhalbe kept in the way: As Peter plainly teacheth, 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 1.5. which are kept by the power of God through faith vnto ſaluation, which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſhowed in the laſt time. And 1. Cor. 1.9. God is faithfull by whom ye are called into the fellow ſhippe of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde: to him be honor and glorie world with out end. Amen.</p>
